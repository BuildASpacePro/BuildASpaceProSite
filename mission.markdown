Within the next few decades, millions of humans will travel into space and expand civilisation further into our solar system. To accelerate the pace at which that future happens, the aerospace industry needs to improve the methods at which knowledge, experience and lessons are documented and disseminated. Every aerospace student should have all the tools and knowledge available so that they can build that future.
